# This is the official list of people who have contributed code to
# crane.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file lists people.
# For example, Globo.com employees are listed here but not in AUTHORS,
# because Globo.com holds the copyright.
#
# You can update this list using the following command:
#
#   % git shortlog -se | awk '{$1=""; print $0}' | sed -e 's/^ //'
#
# Please keep this file sorted, and group users with multiple emails.
