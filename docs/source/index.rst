-----------------------------------------

We provide pre-built binaries for OS X and Linux, only for the amd64
architecture. You can download these binaries directly from the releases page:

* **crane**: https://github.com/tsuru/crane/releases

Using homebrew (Mac OS X only)
------------------------------

If you use Mac OS X and `homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_, you may
use a custom tap to install **crane**. First you need to add the tap:

.. highlight:: bash

::

$ brew tap tsuru/homebrew-tsuru

Now you can install **crane**:

.. highlight:: bash

::

$ brew install crane

Whenever a new version of **crane** is out, you can just run:

.. highlight:: bash

::

$ brew update
$ brew upgrade crane

For more details on taps, check `homebrew documentation
<https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/wiki/brew-tap>`_.

.. note::

    **crane** requires Go 1.4. Make sure you have the last version
    of Go installed in your system.

Using the PPA (Ubuntu only)
---------------------------

Ubuntu users can install tsuru clients using ``apt-get`` and the `tsuru PPA
<https://launchpad.net/~tsuru/+archive/ppa>`_. You'll need to add the PPA
repository locally and run an ``apt-get update``:

.. highlight:: bash

::

$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:tsuru/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update

Now you can install **crane** clients:

.. highlight:: bash

::

$ sudo apt-get install crane

Using AUR (ArchLinux only)
--------------------------

Archlinux users can build and install tsuru admin from AUR repository,
Is needed to have installed `yaourt <http://archlinux.fr/yaourt-en>`_ program.

You can run:


.. highlight:: bash

::

$ yaourt -S tsuru

Build from source (Linux and Mac OS X)
--------------------------------------

.. note::

    If you're feeling adventurous, you can try it on other systems, like
    FreeBSD, OpenBSD or even Windows. Please let us know about your progress!

`tsuru admin source <https://github.com/tsuru/crane>`_ is written in `Go
<http://golang.org>`_, so before installing tsuru from source, please make sure
you have `installed and configured Go <http://golang.org/doc/install>`_.

With Go installed and configured, you can use ``go get`` to install **crane**:

.. highlight:: bash

::

$ go get github.com/tsuru/crane

After installing, you must set the target with the tsuru server URL,
something like:

Managing remote tsuru server endpoints
======================================

The target is the **tsuru** server to which all operations will be directed to.

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ crane target-add <label> <address> [--set-current|-s]
    $ crane target-list
    $ crane target-set <label>
    $ crane target-remove <label>

With this set of commands you are be able to add a new labeled target,
set a target for usage, list the added targets and remove a target, respectively.

Check current version
=====================

To see the current version of **crane** you should use the `version` command:

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ crane version
    crane version 0.6.3.

Authentication
==============

login
-----

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ crane login [<email>]

Login will ask for the password and check if the user is successfully
authenticated. If so, the token generated by the **tsuru** server will be stored
in ${HOME}/.tsuru_token.

All crane actions require the user to be authenticated (except `login` and `version`).

logout
------

.. highlight:: bash

::

    $ crane logout

Logout will delete the token file and terminate the session within tsuru server.
